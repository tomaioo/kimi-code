# Changelog

This page documents the changes in each Kimi Code CLI release.

## 0.4.0

### Features

- Add user-global plugin installation, interactive plugin management, plugin-provided skills, and plugin-owned MCP servers.
- Expand folded paste markers on second paste.
- Rework tool permissions: reads outside cwd no longer prompt, session approvals match the exact call, and path-based rules are case-insensitive.
- Add `/export-debug-zip` slash command to export the current session as a debug ZIP archive directly from the TUI.
- Add `/export-md` slash command to export the current session as a Markdown file.

### Bug Fixes

- Prevent the TUI from crashing when pull request lookup fails during startup.
- Fix thinking spinner leaking past turn end when an empty thinking delta creates an orphaned thinking component.
- Show the original session resume command after forking a session.
- Restrict plugin zip installs to manifests at the archive root or a single wrapper directory.
- Route session-tagged log entries exclusively to the session sink instead of duplicating them to the global sink. Consistently omit stable main-agent context keys from all session log lines that carry `agentId=main`.

### Refactors

- Refactor TUI resume replay logic.
- Use one retry classification for transient LLM failures across regular turns and compaction.

### Other

- Enhance `kimi export` to include more diagnostic information in the manifest.

## 0.3.0

### Features

- `/logout` now opens a picker so you can choose which provider to log out of, instead of always logging out the one tied to the current model. The current provider is highlighted by default, so pressing Enter matches the previous behavior. The command is also available as `/disconnect`.
- The `openai` provider now works out of the box for OpenAI-compatible reasoner models: it auto-detects thinking fields in responses (`reasoning_content` / `reasoning_details` / `reasoning`) and auto-injects `reasoning_effort` when history contains prior thinking. DeepSeek, Qwen, One API and other gateway-fronted services no longer need a hand-set `reasoning_key`, which remains available as an explicit override for non-standard gateways.

### Bug Fixes

- Prevent running the `/model` and `/sessions` slash commands while streaming or compacting context.
- Preserve catalog-declared interleaved reasoning fields for OpenAI-compatible models configured through `/connect`.
- Fix API key input dialog showing a masked dot in empty state.
- Fix user skills in `~/.agents/` not being loaded.
- Restore real-time token display for running subagents in the TUI.
- Hide the todo panel on resume when all todos are already completed.
- Always emit a paired tool result when a tool returns a malformed or missing result, preventing the next request from failing with a missing tool_call_id error.
- Fix Plan mode session resets so new sessions no longer fail after plan review rejection and continue receiving events after setup errors.
- Exit promptly when the controlling terminal goes away. The TUI now handles `SIGHUP` / `SIGTERM` and stdout/stderr `EIO` / `EPIPE` / `ENOTCONN` errors, preventing leftover `kimi` processes that pin a CPU core after the parent shell or multiplexer dies unexpectedly.
- Avoid overly small local completion caps that can truncate reasoning before summaries are produced.

### Refactors

- Make `AgentRecords` hold the `Agent` instance directly and inline the restore dispatch logic.

### Other

- Improve the Write tool UX.

## 0.2.0

### Features

- Add a `/connect` command that configures a provider and model from a model catalog.
- The `/connect` provider and model pickers now support type-to-search filtering, and long lists are paginated. The `/model` picker is also paginated when many models are configured.
- Add `Ctrl-J` as an additional shortcut for inserting new lines in the TUI prompt.
- Add wire record migration handling during session replay.
- Migrate user skills from `~/.kimi/skills/` to `~/.kimi-code/skills/` during the first-launch migration; existing target skills are kept.
- Emit session resume hint as a structured meta message in stream-json output format.

### Bug Fixes

- Report the macOS product version in OAuth device information instead of the Darwin kernel version.
- Correct the `X-Msh-Platform` header value to `kimi_code_cli`.
- Clarify the prompt-mode error when no model is configured by pointing users to the login flow.
- Hide the empty current session from the sessions picker while keeping other empty sessions visible.
- Stop mentioning OAuth credentials in the migration UI — they are never migrated, so the previous "needs /login" notice misread as a failure. OAuth-only installs no longer trigger the migration screen.
- Surface API-provided error messages during feedback, usage, login, and model setup failures.
- Persist model selections from the terminal UI to the default configuration, and honor the configured default thinking state for new sessions.
- Retry compaction responses that do not contain a summary before updating conversation history.
- Avoid CPU spikes from large streamed tool arguments and coalesce high-frequency streaming UI updates.
- Resume sessions with a newer wire protocol version instead of failing. A warning is now shown in the TUI and records are replayed without migration.
- Warn tmux users when extended key settings may prevent modified Enter shortcuts from working.
- Let Kimi requests use the remaining context window for completion tokens by default while keeping explicit environment limits as hard caps.

### Refactors

- Flatten tool call data by inlining tool names and arguments at the top level, and limit legacy record migration so it only rewrites matching tool call payloads.
- Move wire metadata handling into the record layer and keep persistence backends limited to storage operations.

### Other

- When no models are configured, `/model` and the welcome panel now point users to `/login` (for Kimi) and `/connect` (for other providers).
